# Lab 04 - Design Rehosting Migration V2

### Instructions

Write a 1-page high-level design (HLD) document for a lift-and-shift migration of the following application.

The application consists of two virtual machines: WebServerVM and SQLVM. For high availability in the cloud, the web server will be containerized using Docker and hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and the SQL database will be migrated to a Managed SQL Database service. The application can handle no more than 6 hours of downtime.
