# Lab 5 - Design Rehosting migration

### Instructions

Write one page High-Level Design (HLD) document for migrating a 3-tier eCommerce application to a cloud-native architecture.

The application consists of:

A Frontend Web Server running on WebAppVM
A Backend API Server running on APIVM
A SQL Database running on DBVM
The application requires load balancing for the frontend and auto-scaling capabilities for both the API and database tiers. Data consistency is critical, and downtime must not exceed 2 hours.

Insert more technical details of application infrastructure, current configurations, and services

Your HLD should include the following:

A detailed solution diagram showing the cloud-native target architecture (e.g., load balancers, managed databases, autoscaling groups)
A description of how the target architecture addresses scalability, availability, and disaster recovery
A step-by-step breakdown of the migration process, including necessary considerations such as data migration, testing, and rollback strategies
Make sure to leverage resources from AWS or GCP
