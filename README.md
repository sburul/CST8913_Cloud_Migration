# BOYNER - Microsoft Azure Migration Project

<b>BOYNER</b>, one of Turkiye's largest fashion retailers, has switched to cloud technologies to adapt its technology infrastructure to the rapid growth trend. They moved their server infrastructure to Azure by collaborating with Microsoft Turkiye without working with third-party companies during the transition process.

### What are the company's motivators of migration to the cloud?

BOYNER's IT infrastructure was quite fragmented and complex, spread across on-premises data centers and multiple cloud platforms. This structure increased operational costs and led to challenges related to quality, latency, and performance. Therefore, the company wanted to address these issues by working with Microsoft Turkiye.

### What questions will you ask to understand more about the company infrastructure?

<li>Could you provide a detailed info of the current IT infrastructure, including on-premises and cloud components?</li>
<li>What are the main applications and workloads running on your current infrastructure?</li>
<li>What is the current level of expertise within your IT Team regarding cloud technologies and platforms</li>
